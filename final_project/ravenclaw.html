            <h2>What Makes a Ravenclaw?</h2>
                <p>Ravenclaw is home to the brightest and most astute students (with a couple of notable exceptions like Hermione Granger). The Ravenclaw’s can be seen wearing a rich blue and regal bronze, their emblem is an eagle, and the Head of House is Professor Filius Flitwick. Much like an eagle making its nest at the perch of a mountain the common room sits at the top of Ravenclaw Tower behind an enchanted knocker. </p>
                <p>The Sorting Hat would only put you in this house if you demonstrated excellent wisdom, wit and a skill for learning. Ravenclaws are often known for being quite eccentric and most of the great wizarding inventors and innovators have come from this house.</p>
                <p>We can imagine that you would get to sit up in Ravenclaw Tower, while surveying the excellent views, if you’re the type of person who analyzes everything, is an overachiever, can be described as having your head in the clouds, is not afraid to be an individual and has a head stuffed full of interesting facts.</p>
