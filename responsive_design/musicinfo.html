             <p>Lo-fi music now refers to an entirely instrumental brand of sample-based hip-hop beat production—and its sprawling community of beatmakers, listeners and live streaming playlists.
            The genre has exploded in popularity over the last few years, especially on YouTube.
            So you might be interested in learning more about the new genre. Especially, if you want to create lo-fi tracks of your own</p>

            <h2>Lofi Hip-Hop</h2>
            <img src="images/lofi_cassette_tape.jpg" alt="lofi cassette picture">
            <p>This is perhaps the most popular genre of lo-fi. In general, lo-fi takes a lot of inspiration from hip hop — in particular, their use of drum loops to create rhythm.
                 It is the backbone of the lo-fi genre, with its roots firmly planted in jazz and 90s hip-hop. Lo-fi hip-hop tracks often feature vinyl crackles, tape hiss, and other 
                 artifacts that evoke a nostalgic feel. The most prominent YouTube artist for this genre is Lofi Girl, who popularized the genre as well as the iconic image of a Lofi Girl studying.
                  Other notable artists in this subgenre include J Dilla, Nujabes, and Tomppabeats.</p>

            <h3>Lofi Jazz</h3>
            <img src="images/lofi_record_player.png" alt="lofi record player">
            <p>Lo-fi jazz is often a more soothing genre than lo-fi hip hop. It makes the most use of string and wind instruments, and it contains a swing and syncopation typical to traditional jazz music. 
                As the name suggests, a key element of this genre is jazz chord progressions, which provide the music with a more thoughtful and somewhat emotional element than its hip-hop counterpart.</p>

            <h3>Lofi House</h3>
            <img src="images/japandi_neon_wallpaper_16-9_02.jpg" alt="lofi girl">
            <p>Often described as hearing nightclub music from the outside, lo-fi house takes on a more upbeat rhythm compared to other lo-fi genres. This genre mixes the catchy rhythm of the 80s & 90s dance music and combines it with the often-calmer vibe of lo-fi music. The production techniques in
                  lo-fi house lean towards tape saturation, bit-crushing, and analog warmth, creating a distinctively rough yet danceable sound. The result is a nostalgic mix that is perfect to keep you focused 
                  and awake while working.</p>

            <img src="images/create-vaporwave-lofi-chillwave-illustrations.jpg" alt="lofi vaporwave picture">
            <p>More commonly known as chillwave, lo-fi vaporwave is a genre characterized by its faded sound and escapist lyrics and draws inspiration from 80s and 90s pop culture, video games, and electronic music.
                 Its retro pop sound is often mixed with heavy effects and vintage synthesizers. These subgenres heavily rely on sampling and manipulation of retro sounds, creating a nostalgic yet futuristic atmosphere..</p>
