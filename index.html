        <h2>The Origins of "Lofi"</h2>
        <img src="intro_to_html_images/lofi_guy_recording_music.jpg" alt="Lofi music image">
        <p>The term “lo-fi” was first commonly used in the 1950’s. It is short for “low-fidelity”, which means low quality. During this decade, young people from all over were inspired to record their own music with the equipment and gear available to them at the time. Lo-fi has been characterized by the inclusion of elements normally viewed as undesirable in professional contexts, due to the sounds imperfections. WFMU disc jockey William Berger is usually credited with popularizing the term in 1986, but to say that you can point to one true origin of lo-fi on a map would be false.</p>

        <p>Lofi girl first appeared in ChilledCow’s “Beats to Relax/Study To” in 2017, she was modeled after Shizuku Tsukishima from Studio Ghibli’s Whisper of the Heart. Eventually, Lofi girl became incredibly famous, and she became a symbol with whom viewers and listeners could identify and connect with people all over the world. Her rise in popularity and art style gained popularity with visual artists and gave rise to the Lofi visual aesthetic. This aesthetic uses muted tones and mundane imagery to evoke a feeling of calm and nostalgia much like its musical counterpart.</p>
